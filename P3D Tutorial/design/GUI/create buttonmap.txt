To create the button_map.egg file you need to call the following command that get
installed with the Panda3D SDK. You must make sure, the png files given to it do
exist and, as they are used for the main menu's buttons they should have all the
same size of 800x40 px. The -g option will let us change the frames size, whereas
the values to it were calculated using the actual pixel values for the aspect
ratio and the frames size set to 1 unit in each direction multiplied with the
aspect of the actual image. The -wm parameter was set to clamp so we don't get
color bleeding from one side to another.
